        <hr>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            With the robot now being able to be controlled via PWM commands, this lab extends the motor and driving functions of the robot
            by adding closed-loop PID control. This PID control uses depth information from the TOF sensor to bring more accuracy in the robot's motion.

        <h4>1. Choosing a Task</h4>
        <p>
          The first step in this lab was choosing a task to be performed with PID control, as based on this task different code had to be 
          written. For each of these tasks, we needed to ensure to log data to be able to plot and review the robot's behaviors, and also prepare for future labs
          where data export will also be required. I ended up choosing <b>Task A: Don't Hit the Wall!</b> which had as goal to stop the robot when it's 300mm
          away from the wall.  
        </p>

        <h4>2. Designing the PID Controller</h4>
        <p>
            Given time contraints, i chose to focus on getting the P(ID) portion of the PID controller to work well. I had also heard from other people in the lab
            and from TA's that the robot performed well under just the P term of the PID controller, so decided to move forward with this.  

        </p>

        <p>
            For the P term of the PID controller, I calculated the difference between the distance from the goal and the desired distance (in this case 300mm),
            and once a value returned I multiplied the value by a gain value Kp. This essentially translated the distance different with gain multiplication into a 
            control value for the robot - which is strongly dependent on the gain. This code is shown below: 
        </p>

        <p><em>Figure 2: P(id) control code </em></p>
        <br>

        <p>
            In order to give the robot a range in which it was deemed reasonable to have reached its endgoal, the speeds at which the robot goes
            striaght or backwards were set between a range of -2 and 2, essentially allowing for it to stop moving if it's within a small margin of error.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Tuning the Motor Driver Functions for PID</h4>
        <p>
            Considering how the PID controller outputs positive and negative values, I had to go back and adjust my motor control code
            to deal with negative as well as positive inputs. I did this by simply converting any negative passed inputs to positive values (to the backwards function),
            assuming that a negative value passed to the backwards function simply is the output of a PID calculation. Additionally, I realized that the PID controller
            tended to output value above or below the maximum control values accepted by the robot (25 and 255). I therefore added code
            to convert any values above or below these to their respective maxima and minima. This is shown below:
        </p>

        <h4>4. PID Experiments</h4>
        <p>
          This code was tested in the lab environment, and was found to repeatably result in accurate PID motion for the robot. The values used for Kp
          ranged from <code>0.03</code> to <code>0.07</code>, with <code>0.05</code> deemed to be the value delivering the best results. A further discussion below will compare plots
          of each Kp value to determine any meaningful differences. Below, a PID run is demonstrated at a Kp value of 0.07, which is slightly too high resulting in a light tap of the wall.
          The videos of the run at 0.03 and 0.05 unfortunately seemed to have been corrupted as I could not find them on my phone.

        <h4>5. Discussion</h4>
        <h5>Time vs. Distance</h5>
        <p>
          Data was collected over the runs at a gain value of 0.03, 0.04, and 0.07. Below are plots demonstrating the time vs. distance values for different Kp gain factors.
        </p>

        <br>
        <img src="../images/lab6-4.JPG"  alt="Part 2: Nope Setup" width="50%">
        <p><em>Figure 4: PID Control, Time vs Distance at various Kp values</em></p>
        <br>

        <p>
            What can be deduced from the below graph, is that a higher value for Kp does not necessarily result in the robot reaching its 
            destination faster. In this case, the Kp of 0.07 overshoots the desired location significantly, and correct be undershooting, and 
            eventually reaches the 300mm destination. On the other hand, the 0.03 and 0.04 factors do not overshoot nearly as much, leading to less back
            and forth motion before reaching the end-position.
        </p>

        <h5>Time vs. PWM</h5>
        <p>
            Data for PWM control values were also saved and plotted, resulting into similar insights:
          </p>

          <br>
          <img src="../images/lab6-5.JPG"  alt="Part 2: Nope Setup" width="50%">
          <p><em>Figure 5: PID Control, Time vs PWM at various Kp values</em></p>
          <br>

          <p>
            Similarly, the PWM control values are far higher for a Kp of 0.07, resulting in a lot of overshooting and undershooting as the robot
            speeds up to fast and significantly misses its target, needing to correct. Kps of 0.03 and 0.04 on the other hand experience a smoother 
            process towards the end-destination.
